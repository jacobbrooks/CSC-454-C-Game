# CSC-454-C-Game
My implementation of Professor Alex Pantaleev's "Room Game" where various creature types occupy 5 rooms with varying states of cleanliness. The object of the game is for the playable character to clean/dirty the rooms strategically to earn the maximum amount of respect of the creatures who have different preferences for the cleanliness of the room they are in.
